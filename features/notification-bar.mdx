Labellerr's **Notification Bar** is a dedicated collaboration feature designed to streamline communication and boost productivity in annotation teams. It enables instant tag-based messaging, keeps everyone in the loop, and ensures complex labeling queries are resolved quickly—without disrupting your workflow.

## Key Features

*   **Tag Team Members Directly:** Seek second opinions or escalate queries by tagging any colleague (including annotators and reviewers) right within the platform.
*   **Visual Alerts:**
    *   **Red Dot:** Appears on the dashboard for the tagged recipient, indicating an action or response is needed.
    *   **Blue Dot:** Shows which messages remain unread in a user’s notification inbox.
*   **One-Click Navigation:** Click any notification to immediately jump to the relevant labeling window—saving time and reducing confusion.
*   **Inbox Filtering:** Organize notifications with filtering options, making it easy to keep track of pending, read, or resolved issues.
*   **External Integration:** The notification inbox can be linked to Slack for real-time, cross-platform collaboration.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Identify an Annotation Query:** While annotating (e.g., unsure whether to label a jacket under the "man" class), highlight the relevant area using the tool’s remark or comment function.

2.  **Tag a Team Member:** Tag any team member, reviewer, or stakeholder—whether they’re on your team or the client side—directly in the tool.

3.  **Notification Delivery:** The tagged person sees a **red dot** on their dashboard, signaling that a response is needed.

4.  **Message Status Tracking:** A **blue dot** appears for any notification that remains unread by the recipient.

5.  **Jump to Task:** The team member can click the notification to open the corresponding labeling instance and respond immediately.

6.  **Update Read Status:** Marking a notification as read will automatically update its status, helping the entire team track what’s been addressed.

7.  **Keep Inbox Tidy:** Use the filtering options to sort, organize, and manage messages (by status, type, project, etc.).

## Benefits

*   **Faster Resolution:** Speeds up decision-making by instantly alerting the right people for feedback or validation.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Notification inboxes can link to Slack, ensuring communication flows across platforms teams already use.
*   **Clear Accountability:** Red and blue dots visually track what needs attention and what’s been handled.
*   **Boosts Productivity:** Prevents annotation delays, so the workflow continues smoothly without searching for or waiting on responses.

## Best Practices

*   Tag only relevant team members to keep communication focused.
*   Regularly check your notification bar for updates—respond promptly to keep projects moving.
*   Use inbox filters to locate unresolved issues or specific categories of queries quickly.
*   Integrate with Slack if your team relies on external messaging for broader visibility.
