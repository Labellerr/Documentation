  <Card title="What is the “Copy from” feature?">
    To save labeling time, [Labellerr](https://www.linkedin.com/company/labellerr/) has introduced copy the label feature which reduces the time spent on each image by up to 70%.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Benefits of Copy from">
    The average time spent by annotators on labeling classifications with an average of 60-70 labels per image is around 10000 hrs. In most of the projects, up to 70% of labels are the same, it's just 30% of labels that changes with every image/video. If it's a video project, the time would go up by 150%. Now, the annotators can leverage their past annotations and copy all the labels with just a click.
  </Card>

  <Card title="How it works">
    For large and diverse datasets, our system sorts the annotated image based on the similarity with the highest chance of similar labels. This additionally saves annotators time to look for the right image to copy, because it will always be at the top.
