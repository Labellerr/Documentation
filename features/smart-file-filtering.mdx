Labellerr's new **Smart File Filtering** feature revolutionizes how you manage and navigate your image datasets. It lets you find exactly what you need **in seconds**, saving hours spent manually searching for images. This powerful tool allows users to apply **multiple advanced filters simultaneously** across their dataset, providing laser-precise results with just a few clicks.

## What Can You Filter By?

*   **Last Updated User:** Find files updated by specific users to track contributions or assignments.
*   **Objects Present in Images:** Filter images containing specific objects such as cars, bikes, people, etc.
*   **Classifications:** Narrow results using classification labels like weather conditions, traffic density, etc.
*   **Custom Attributes:** Use your project-specific attributes for further granularity (e.g., number of cars in an image).
*   **Combination Filters:** Apply multiple filter conditions simultaneously for incredibly precise search.

## Real-Life Example: Filtering Traffic Images

Imagine you want to find images meeting these conditions:

*   Sunny weather
*   Less than 10 cars
*   Presence of bikes
*   More than or equal to 2 large vehicles
*   High traffic condition

### How to Apply Filters Step-by-Step

#### Filter by Object:

Select images containing _bikes_ and _large vehicles_ (â‰¥ 2).

#### Filter by Classification:

Choose _high traffic_ and _sunny weather_ classifications.

#### Filter by Attribute:

Add an attribute filter to exclude images with exactly 10 cars (e.g., "cars < 10").

#### Result:

The system instantly returns seven images matching all these combined filters.

## Key Benefits

*   âš¡ **Dramatically Faster Search:** Find specific images in seconds, not hours.
*   ðŸŽ¯ **Highly Precise Filtering:** Combine multiple filters on objects, classifications, and attributes to get exactly what you need.
*   ðŸ“Š **Instant Review & Actions:** Review filtered images quickly, assign tasks, or prepare exports without leaving the filter interface.
*   ðŸš€ **Boost Workflow Efficiency:** Speeds up the entire annotation process by streamlining data organization and retrieval.

## How to Use Smart File Filtering

1.  Open the **File Section** in your Labellerr project.
2.  Choose the **filter icon** to open filter options.
3.  Select filters based on:
    *   **User:** Filter files by the last person who updated them.
    *   **Objects:** Check the boxes next to objects that should be present.
    *   **Classifications:** Pick classification labels relevant to your search.
    *   **Attributes:** Set attribute conditions like numeric values or categorical options.
4.  Combine multiple filter types as needed for a refined search.
5.  View your filtered results instantly.
6.  Use the options to:
    *   **Review images.**
    *   **Assign files** to team members or yourself.
    *   **Export filtered datasets** for use in training or analysis.

## Best Practices

*   **Use Combination Filters for Complex Queries:** Filter by objects, classifications, and attributes together to narrow your dataset effectively.
*   **Validate Filter Results:** Confirm that the filtered files meet the criteria by spot-checking a few samples.
*   **Assign Tasks Efficiently:** Use the filtering results to assign relevant files to proper team members based on content type or annotation progress.
*   **Export Relevant Data:** Prepare datasets tailored to project needs by exporting the filtered subset directly from the tool.
