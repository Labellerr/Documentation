**Event Tagging** is the process of marking specific segments or moments in a video timeline that correspond to important or noteworthy events. Each tag typically includes:

*   The **start time** of the event.
*   The **end time** (adjustable).
*   A **name or label** describing the event (e.g., "Goran Dragic’s clutch 2-pointer" or "Foul on LeBron").

This transforms raw video into structured, searchable data that can be accessed instantly.

### Step 1: Upload Your Video

*   Upload your video file in the Labellerr platform’s video annotation section.
*   Play the video to identify key moments you want to tag.

### Step 2: Set the Timeline Head at the Start of the Event

*   Move the video timeline slider to the exact timestamp where the event begins (e.g., a dunk, foul, or highlight).

### Step 3: Create an Event Tag

*   Click on the **event tagging** button/icon.
*   Enter a descriptive name for the event — for example, “Foul on LeBron” or “Clutch 2-pointer by Goran Dragic.”

### Step 4: Adjust Tag Duration

*   Adjust the length of the tag by dragging its edges on the timeline to cover the entire event duration.
*   The tag can also be moved along the timeline to refine its placement.

### Step 5: Manage and Organize Tags

*   Repeat the steps to map out additional key moments in your video.
*   The collection of event tags forms a searchable, time-indexed database of important moments.
