**A new AI model from Meta AI that can "cut out" any object, in any image, with a single click.**

SAM is a promptable segmentation system with zero-shot generalization to unfamiliar objects and images, without the need for additional training.

We have used the capability of **SAM** to build a more accurate and fast annotation pipeline. This feature **enables a user to draw segmentation around an object via only a single click on that object.**

<Note>
Before going forward, please ensure that you are familiar with the Annotation Projects, Datasets and Annotation Pipelines at Labellerr. If not please visit the below links :-

</Note>

First we need to create a polygon type annotation question with the name of object that we want to auto-segment. Select that polygon object. An auto segment icon in the icons list above the file will appear. Click on the auto segment icon , Select ‘**Interact**’.

Click on the required object to auto label in the image. Wait for a few seconds, the object will be segmented.
