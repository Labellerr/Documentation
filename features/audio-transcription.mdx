Labellerr's **audio analyser** would help the AI scientist obtain an accurate transcription of the audio recording. Also, the AI scientist can obtain the essence of the conversation, the next steps after the conversation, and things like that.

**Gemini API**, configured to send responses to the UI of the platform, sends measured analysis of data that has been integrated with Labellerr. (The user has to enter the right question in the prompt window).

Below is a sample audio file analysed by **Labellerr's Audio analyser.**

The template configuration setup is located in the 'Label Configuration' section on the project creation page.

Once satisfied with the description/transcription, click the "**Submit**" button to submit the file.

The file will be sent to a reviewer, who can also view the audio file and edit the output if necessary.

Reviewers can access files for review by navigating to the "Review" page from the dashboard.
