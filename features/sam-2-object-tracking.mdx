# Labellerr: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) Video Object Tracking Documentation

## Introduction

Labellerr's SAM 2 enables **10x faster video object tracking** compared to manual annotation, making it ideal for annotating moving objects—such as players and balls in sports videos—across frames with minimal effort. This AI-powered tool streamlines the process, saving significant time and ensuring high-accuracy results in sports analytics, robotics, retail, and agriculture.

## Key Features

- **AI-driven, frame-by-frame object tracking**
- Compatible with multiple label types (player, ball, etc.)
- Combines manual annotation, point prompts, and automated tracking
- Efficiently handles occlusions and out-of-frame moments

## Step-by-Step Guide: Using SAM 2 for Video Object Tracking

### 1. Preparing the Video and Labels

- **Upload your video** to the Labellerr platform.
- Play the video briefly to familiarize yourself with its content.
- **Create labels** for each object you want to track (e.g., `player`, `ball`).

### 2. Annotating Key Frames with SAM 2

#### a. Select Object and Annotation Tool

- Select the relevant label (e.g., `ball`).
- Click the **Magic Brush** and choose **Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)** from the dropdown menu.

#### b. Add Point Prompts

- Click the *interact* icon to begin.
- Place point prompts on the object to help the model segment it accurately.
- Confirm the segmentation by clicking the tick icon.

#### c. Track Object Across Video

- Right-click on the object and select **SAM 2 Tracking**.
- SAM 2 automatically tracks and segments the object across the entire video timeline.
- **Repeat for additional objects** (e.g., select `player` and follow the same steps).

### 3. Reviewing and Adjusting Tracks

#### a. Timeline Visualization

- Tracked objects appear on a colored timeline.
- Colored dots indicate **present**, **absent**, or **segmentation error**.
- Gaps in the timeline indicate occlusion or the object moving out of frame.

#### b. Handling Occlusions & Errors

- If SAM 2 misses a frame:
  - Right-click and select **Mark Out of View** (if object is absent).
  - Right-click and select **Mark in View** (if object is present).

#### c. Seamless Results

- Play the labeled video to preview accurate object tracking across all frames.

### 4. Customizing Annotations (Optional)

- Use **bounding boxes** for simple shapes (e.g., players).
- Use **polygons** for small or irregular objects (e.g., balls).
- Add **attributes** (e.g., player activity, jersey color) and **video-wide classifications** for detailed datasets.

### 5. Firing Multiple Annotation Jobs

Labellerr supports running **multiple annotation jobs simultaneously**, speeding up large-scale video annotation.

#### How It Works

1. Upload your videos and create object labels.
2. Select objects to annotate.
3. Click the **SAM 2 button** in the object header.
4. Choose the object for this job.
5. Click **Run** to automatically track and segment the object across all frames.

### 6. Running SAM 2 on a Single Timeline

You can track multiple objects continuously in a single workflow.

#### How It Works

- Upload your video and create labels for all objects.
- Select each object to include in the timeline job.
- Right-click on the timeline, choose **SAM 2 Tracking**, and select **Run SAM 2**.
- Monitor progress in the **Timeline** section, where colored dots indicate object presence, absence, or segmentation errors.

## Benefits

- **Dramatically faster:** Reduces hours of manual tracking to just a few clicks.
- **High accuracy:** AI leverages previous frame information to minimize drift and errors.
- **Flexible:** Suitable for any moving object in videos—sports, robotics, animals, retail, etc.
- **Easy error correction:** Quick manual fixes via right-click if predictions are off.
