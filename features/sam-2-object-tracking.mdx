# Labellerr: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) Video Object Tracking Documentation

## Introduction

Labellerr's SAM 2 enables **10x faster video object tracking**, making it ideal for annotating moving objects—such as players and balls in sports videos—across frames with minimal manual effort. This AI-powered tool streamlines the process, saving significant time and ensuring high-accuracy results in fields like sports analytics, robotics, retail, and agriculture.

## Key Features

*   **AI-driven, frame-by-frame object tracking**
*   Compatible with various label types (player, ball, etc.)
*   Combines manual annotation, point prompts, and automated tracking
*   Handles occlusions and out-of-frame moments efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Using SAM 2 for Video Object Tracking

### 1. Preparing the Video and Labels

*   **Upload your video** to the Labellerr platform.
*   Go to the _label_ tab and play the video briefly to familiarize yourself with content.
*   **Create labels** for each object you want to track (e.g., 'player', 'ball').

### 2. Annotating Key Frames with SAM 2

#### a. Select Object and Annotation Tool

*   Select the relevant label (e.g., 'ball').
*   Click the **Magic Brush** and choose _Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)_ from the dropdown menu.

#### b. Add Point Prompts

*   Click the _interact_ icon to begin.
*   Place point prompts on the object you want to track, helping the model identify/segment it clearly.
*   When the object is properly segmented, confirm by clicking the tick icon.

#### c. Track Object Across Video

*   Right-click and choose **SAM 2 track**.
*   SAM 2 automatically tracks and segments the object across the full video timeline (e.g., tracks the ball as it moves).
*   **Repeat for additional objects** (e.g., select 'player' and follow the same procedure).

### 3. Reviewing and Adjusting Tracks

#### a. Timeline Visualization

*   Tracked objects are shown on a colored timeline (red dots mark presence/absence/segmentation).
*   Gaps in the timeline indicate occlusion or the object moving out of frame.

#### b. Handling Occlusions & Errors

*   If the model misses a frame (e.g., predicts the object as out of view, but it is visible, or vice versa), right-click and select:
    *   **Mark Out of View** (if object is absent)
    *   **Mark in View** (if object is present)

#### c. Seamless Results

*   Play the labeled video to preview how objects are accurately tracked throughout.

### 4. Customizing Annotations (Optional)

*   Use bounding boxes for simple shapes (e.g., players).
*   Use polygons for more precise objects (e.g., balls), with support for single-dot/polygon labeling.
*   Add attributes (e.g., player activity, jersey color) and video-wide classifications for detailed datasets.

## Benefits

*   **Dramatically faster:** Reduces hours of manual tracking to just a few clicks.
*   **High accuracy:** AI leverages previous frame information, minimizing drift and error.
*   **Flexible:** Suitable for any moving object in a video—sports, robotics, animals, retail, and more.
*   **Easy error correction:** Quick manual fixes with just a right-click if the prediction is off.

## Best Practices

*   Place prompts precisely for clean initial segmentation.
*   For complex objects, use polygons instead of bounding boxes.
*   Review each track for gaps or mispredictions—SAM 2 makes correction easy.
*   Enhance annotation quality by adding object attributes and video classifications.

**Example Workflow:** “Upload a video, label the ball and player, use the Magic Brush and SAM 2 to annotate initial frames, then let SAM 2 track each object automatically. Review the tracking, fix any missed frames, and add useful attributes or classifications if needed. Save hours while maintaining accuracy—perfect for demanding AI workflows.”

Labellerr’s SAM 2 video annotation tool is designed to make meticulous video object tracking fast, efficient, and scalable—perfect for modern AI projects that demand quality at speed.
