# Labellerr: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) Video Object Tracking Documentation

## Introduction

Labellerr's SAM 2 enables **10x faster video object tracking**, making it ideal for annotating moving objects—such as players and balls in sports videos—across frames with minimal manual effort. This AI-powered tool streamlines the process, saving significant time and ensuring high-accuracy results in fields like sports analytics, robotics, retail, and agriculture.

## Key Features

{/* @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} */}

- **AI-driven, frame-by-frame object tracking**
- Compatible with various label types (player, ball, etc.)
- Combines manual annotation, point prompts, and automated tracking
- Handles occlusions and out-of-frame moments efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Using SAM 2 for Video Object Tracking

### 1. Preparing the Video and Labels

- **Upload your video** to the Labellerr platform.
- Go to the _label_ tab and play the video briefly to familiarize yourself with content.
- **Create labels** for each object you want to track (e.g., 'player', 'ball').

### 2. Annotating Key Frames with SAM 2

#### a. Select Object and Annotation Tool

- Select the relevant label (e.g., 'ball').
- Click the **Magic Brush** and choose _Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)_ from the dropdown menu.

#### b. Add Point Prompts

- Click the _interact_ icon to begin.
- Place point prompts on the object you want to track, helping the model identify/segment it clearly.
- When the object is properly segmented, confirm by clicking the tick icon.

#### c. Track Object Across Video

- Right-click and choose **SAM 2 track**.
- SAM 2 automatically tracks and segments the object across the full video timeline (e.g., tracks the ball as it moves).
- **Repeat for additional objects** (e.g., select 'player' and follow the same procedure).

### 3. Reviewing and Adjusting Tracks

#### a. Timeline Visualization

- Tracked objects are shown on a colored timeline (red dots mark presence/absence/segmentation).
- Gaps in the timeline indicate occlusion or the object moving out of frame.

#### b. Handling Occlusions & Errors

- If the model misses a frame (e.g., predicts the object as out of view, but it is visible, or vice versa), right-click and select:
  - **Mark Out of View** (if object is absent)
  - **Mark in View** (if object is present)

#### c. Seamless Results

- Play the labeled video to preview how objects are accurately tracked throughout.

### 4. Customizing Annotations (Optional)

- Use bounding boxes for simple shapes (e.g., players).
- Use polygons for more precise objects (e.g., balls), with support for single-dot/polygon labeling.
- Add attributes (e.g., player activity, jersey color) and video-wide classifications for detailed datasets.

### 5. Ability to Fire Multiple Jobs (New Feature)

Labellerr now supports firing **multiple annotation jobs simultaneously**, making large-scale video annotation faster and more efficient.

#### How It Works

1. **Prepare your videos and labels**
   Upload your videos and create labels for the objects you want to track.
2. **Select objects to annotate**
   Click on the objects you want to process in the video.
3. **Open SAM 2**
   Click the **SAM 2 button** in the object’s header.
4. **Choose the object for the job**
   Pick the object you want to track in this particular job.
5. **Run the job**
   Click the **Run** button. SAM 2 will now automatically track and segment the object across all frames.

### 5. Track Progress (Multi-Job)

Monitor the progress of all jobs in the **Timeline** section. Colored dots indicate whether objects are **present**, **absent**, or if there are **segmentation errors**.

### 6. Ability to Run on a Single Timeline (New Feature)

Labellerr now allows you to **run SAM 2 jobs on a single video timeline**, so you can track objects together in one continuous workflow.

#### How It Works

1. **Prepare your video and labels**
   Upload your video and create labels for all the objects you want to track on that timeline.
2. **Select objects to annotate**
   Click on each object in the video that you want to include in this single timeline job.
3. **Open SAM 2**
   - Right-click on the timeline where you annotated the objects.
   - Click **SAM 2 Tracking** and select **Run SAM 2**.
   SAM 2 will now track all selected objects continuously on the same video timeline.
4. **Monitor Progress**
   - The tracking results are displayed on the **Timeline** section.
   - Colored dots indicate whether objects are **present**, **absent**, or if there are **segmentation errors**.

## Benefits

- **Dramatically faster:** Reduces hours of manual tracking to just a few clicks.
- **High accuracy:** AI leverages previous frame information, minimizing drift and error.
- **Flexible:** Suitable for any moving object in a video—sports, robotics, animals, retail, and more.
- **Easy error correction:** Quick manual fixes with just a right-click if the prediction is off.

## Best Practices

- Place prompts precisely for clean initial segmentation.
- For complex objects, use polygons instead of bounding boxes.
- Review each track for gaps or mispredictions—SAM 2 makes correction easy.
- Enhance annotation quality by adding object attributes and video classifications.

**Example Workflow:** “Upload a video, label the ball and player, use the Magic Brush and SAM 2 to annotate initial frames, then let SAM 2 track each object automatically. Review the tracking, fix any missed frames, and add useful attributes or classifications if needed. Save hours while maintaining accuracy—perfect for demanding AI workflows.”

Labellerr’s SAM 2 video annotation tool is designed to make meticulous video object tracking fast, efficient, and scalable—perfect for modern AI projects that demand quality at speed.
