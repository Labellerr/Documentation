Labellerr’s **Natural Language Search** feature lets you find files, images, or complete datasets instantly—even if you don’t remember exact names or filenames. Powered by AI, you simply type a phrase (just like Google search), and Labellerr scans your workspace, datasets, or images for the content that matches your description. No more endless scrolling or manual checking—just fast, intuitive searching across your data.

## How to Use Natural Language Search

### 1. Enable Natural Language Search

*   **Where to Find It:**
    *   Go to the **settings section** in your Labellerr workspace to see all your datasets, or open a specific dataset to get started.
*   **Activation:**
    *   Look for the **natural language search** option in your dataset or workspace view.

### 2. Enter Your Search Prompt

*   In the search bar, type a plain language description of what you’re looking for.
*   Examples:
    *   “Dataset with a gray car”
    *   “Cake photo”
    *   “Birthday celebration image”
    *   “Red truck on highway”
*   The system supports complex queries (e.g., “sunny beach with family”, “person with dog at park”).

### 3. Refine Your Results

*   **Adjust Confidence Level:**
    *   If your prompt is ambiguous or returns too many results, use the confidence slider to make the search stricter or more relaxed.
*   **Show Matching Datasets/Images:**
    *   Click on “Show Datasets” or “Show Images” to view and explore all files matching your prompt.

### 4. Browse and Organize

*   **Preview Results:**
    *   Click on a result to see images and all related metadata and details.
*   **Organize:**
    *   Use the search to help organize, label, or manage files and datasets as needed.

## Key Benefits

*   **Super-Fast Search:** Locates files and datasets in seconds—even with thousands of images or unorganized folders.
*   **More Than Filename Search:** Works on image content, associated text, and metadata using AI.
*   **No Memory Burden:** Don’t remember the file or dataset name? Just describe what you want.
*   **Powerful for Teams:** Allows creators, businesses, and organizations to manage massive datasets or archives, regardless of storage backend (including Google Drive, cloud platforms, or local storage).
*   **Flexible Use Cases:**
    *   Find specific photos, objects, or scenes
    *   Organize content for projects
    *   Accelerate annotation or content review

## Best Practices

*   Use descriptive and specific prompts for faster, more accurate results.
*   Employ the confidence level adjustment to fine-tune searches.
*   Organize search results into new datasets, or export relevant files for further use.
*   Try natural language search for both images and non-image data (where supported).
