Labellerr's **Magic Editor** is a precision tool designed for effortlessly refining image annotations. It is especially useful for fixing sharp edges, merging missing labels, and smoothing annotation boundaries, making it an ideal solution for projects in retail, medical imaging, and any domain where annotation quality directly impacts AI model performance.

## What Does Magic Editor Do?

Magic Editor allows users to:

*   **Smooth and adjust boundaries** for annotations, eliminating jagged edges.
*   **Merge unlabeled or missed regions** (such as hair, loose clothing, or partially detected objects) into existing annotations with a few clicks.
*   Instantly correct irregular or imprecise annotation areas without disrupting the overall shape.
*   _Quickly touch up_ one-dot labels generated by automated methods like SAM.

## How to Use Magic Editor

### Step 1: Identify Annotation Irregularities

*   Review your annotation. Look for sharp or jagged edges, or spots where the label doesn’t fully cover the target object.

### Step 2: Activate Magic Editor

*   Access Magic Editor within the annotation panel. The feature can be used in conjunction with normal annotation tools or after automated methods like SAM’s one-dot labeling.

### Step 3: Refine with Key Points or Merge Areas

*   **For edge smoothing:** Drag individual key points to gently curve and improve boundary lines. This helps fix sharp or unnatural corners.
*   **To merge unlabeled regions:**
    *   Hold `Shift` and select the starting key point on the object boundary.
    *   Move your cursor across the unlabeled area, right-clicking to cover missed regions.
    *   End by selecting another boundary key point while holding `Shift` again.
    *   For continuous adjustments, hold `Ctrl` and guide the pointer along the desired boundary.

### Step 4: Review the Correction

*   Inspect the updated segmentation mask or bounding polygon to ensure the modification looks natural and the target object is properly enclosed.

### Step 5: Apply and Continue

*   Confirm the adjustment. Continue editing other areas as needed or proceed with your annotation workflow.

## Benefits

*   **Saves Time:** No need to redraw entire masks or shapes—fix only what’s needed.
*   **Increases Accuracy:** Ensures pixel-perfect, label-consistent masks, critical for AI training tasks.
*   **Non-Destructive Workflow:** Edit without disrupting the overall annotation shape or label hierarchy.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Rapid boundary manipulation with Shift and Control keys for faster, smoother work.

## Use Cases

*   **Retail:** Refine product outlines for catalog and inventory automation.
*   **Medical Imaging:** Precisely segment organs, tumors, or anatomical structures where label accuracy affects diagnostic models.
*   **General AI Applications:** Clean up complex shape outlines in people, vehicles, industrial settings, and more.

## Best Practices

*   Use Magic Editor especially after initial automated or SAM-based annotations to catch missed pixels and perfect edges.
*   For highly complex boundaries (e.g., hair or textile frays), employ multiple short refinement actions rather than one large adjustment.
*   Save iterations of your work in case you need to step back or compare edits.
