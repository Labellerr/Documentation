Labellerr has introduced a **grouping tool feature** that enables grouping all labels for a single object into one unit. This helps the AI model better understand the relationship between different parts of an object.

### Steps to Implement the Grouping Tool

1.  **Annotate** all parts of the object.
2.  **Enable** the grouping icon button at the top.
3.  **Draw an area** that covers all annotations of the object.
4.  A **unique ID** will be automatically assigned to all parts of that object.

<Note>
The ID can be changed if any part of the object is mistakenly grouped with another object.

### How to Identify Incorrect IDs?

Labellerr has introduced a **Filter Annotations** icon in front of the annotated objects list.

1.  **Apply the ‘Group’ filter** to check:
    *   If any ID is missing from a group, it will appear under the **‘Ungrouped’** section.
    *   The **‘Grouped’** section will show grouped objects. Hover over them to review.

2.  **Switch to the ‘Question’ option** to see the objects list in their original view.

3.  **Click the ‘Filters’ icon** to:
    *   View grouped and ungrouped objects.
    *   Check objects with remarks left by annotators or reviewers. Users can apply this filter to view remarked annotations, and the count will be displayed in the left panel.
    *   Identify issues like:
        *   ID mismatches between parts of a single object.
        *   Missing attributes where mandatory.
        *   Missing IDs for any annotated object.

4.  **Review a specific object’s annotations.**

This feature improves annotation consistency, reduces errors, and ensures better AI model performance.
