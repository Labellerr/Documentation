## Available Tools

### Pan Tool (Hand Icon)
**Pan Tool(Hand)** icon lets you move the Image after selecting it. This is useful when you want a certain edge of the image or in complex images where detailed annotating is required.

### Display Settings (Gear Icon)
**Display(Gear)** icon lets you change the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation and luminance. It is especially useful for details that are often missed in a very dark/bright picture or for the detection of an object that blends with the environment.

### Zoom Tool
**Zoom** icon as the name suggests lets you zoom in and zoom out. This can be useful when the image pixels are huge and specific pixels have to be highlighted with precision. It also serves as useful while using dot annotation in high pixel images.
