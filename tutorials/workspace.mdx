A workspace is a 'Centralized environment' enabling large organizations to manage and track multiple projects under the same domain.

A single Organization might have a single subsidiary or teams where each team might own a separate workspace. Activities are isolated based on their respective projects. Multiple activities can be performed in a workspace at the same time. Access is restricted based on user authorization. Workspaces on Labellerr are analogous to those on platforms such as Slack.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Role-based Access Control** | Workspaces are configurated based on the level of access granted, meaning that a user is only able to access the content based on their authorization level (which can be changed anytime). For eg., if User A is working as an annotator, then he has access to only annotation. Access to review or export is restricted. |
| **Flexible User Permissions** | Labellerr allows more flexibility by allowing each user to be assigned a different level of clearance in individual projects under the same domain. For e.g. user A can be a 'Super Admin' for project A and an 'Annotator' for project B. |
| **Real-time Updates** | Changes show in real-time that reflect on all the screens of each user working on that workspace. This also allows users from different time zones to work with ease and stay aligned with the team. |
| **Advanced Filtering & Tracking** | It is also easy to Sort files and Track user activity on Labellerr. Sorting can be done throughout Labellerr using filtration options and statistical tracking (which also works in real-time) is always on display on the Dashboard. |

## Switching Workspaces

The interactive UI of Labellerr is quick to grasp and easy to use. Workspaces can be accessed through the switch workspace screen on the top right corner of the dashboard. 

<Warning>
**Only Admins, Superadmins, and Clients owning multiple workspaces can switch workplaces.** Non-admins can only view files for annotation or review on the projects they have been assigned.
