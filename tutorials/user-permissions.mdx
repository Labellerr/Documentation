Workspaces are **configured based on the level of access** granted, meaning that a user is only able to access the content based on their authorization level (which can be changed anytime). For eg., if User A is working as an annotator, then he has access to only annotation. Access to review or export is restricted.

Following is a list of roles that can be assigned to users across parallel workspaces.
