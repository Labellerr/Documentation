## Reviewing File-Level Remarks

### How can the annotator review the remarks given by the client reviewer at file level?

After a file is rejected by the client, it will be reassigned to the reviewer. The reviewer can then view the remarks made during the rejection.

To check remarks from the client on a rejected file:

1. Navigate to the **Label** tab on the dashboard to view the file.

2. Click the timer icon on the right side of the screen to check the file's remarks and activity.

3. Details such as the email ID of the person who gave the remark, the label, the time of the remark, and the feedback will be displayed.

4. To view feedback from the client, look for the label **"rejected by client"**. For reviewer feedback, look for the label **"rejected by reviewer"**.

5. The client's feedback will appear next to the corresponding label.

### To check comments from the client when a file is rejected:

1. Click on the timer icon on the right side of the screen, which shows file activity.

2. This will display the label and the feedback provided.

3. Look for the label **"rejected by client"**.

4. The client's feedback will be shown on the right.
