This guide provides step-by-step instructions for effectively reviewing annotated images, offering suggestions, and providing feedback on potential errors. Follow these guidelines to participate in the annotation review process seamlessly.

### 1. Access the Reviewer Platform

*   Log in to the Labellerr platform using your credentials.
*   Navigate to the "Review" tab on the dashboard.

The review screen is designed just like the labeling page, giving you access to all the same tools. This ensures you have full control over the quality and accuracy of the annotations. You can easily edit, add, or remove annotations as needed to meet your specific requirements.

### 2. Review Annotations and Provide Feedback

The bottom-left part of the screen shows a list of all annotated object names. To provide feedback on a specific annotation:

*   Scroll through the list of annotated object names.
*   As you hover over a specific name, the corresponding object in the image will be highlighted.

While reviewing, you can provide remarks for each annotated object. If there is a mistake in the annotation, specify the mistake, or give suggestions for improvement.

### 3. Add Remarks or Suggestions

*   To give remarks, click the comment icon next to the annotated object's name and type your feedback. Select "Mistake" if the annotation is incorrect, or "Suggestion" to propose improvements. Then, click the "Add Remark" button to submit your feedback.

### 4. Hide Annotated Objects

To hide an annotated object, click the eye icon located to the right of the annotated object's name, just after the comment icon.

To hide all the annotations, click on the eye icon located next to the "Annotations" heading, which groups all the annotated objects.

**Why Itâ€™s Important:**

This feature helps you focus on specific areas of the image by temporarily hiding other annotated objects. It can reduce visual clutter, making it easier to review and analyze individual annotations or their placement in detail.

### 5. Skip, Reject or Accept a file

Once the file screening is complete, you have three options:

1.  To accept the file, click the "Accept" button, and the file will be ready for export.
2.  If there are mistakes or suggestions, click the "Reject" button, and the file will be sent for corrections.
3.  To skip the file and have another review it, click the "Skip" button.

The "Reject" and "Accept" buttons are located at the bottom left of the screen. To the left of the "Reject" button, you'll find a small arrow.
