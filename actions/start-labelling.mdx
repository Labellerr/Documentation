### Annotations

There are six main annotations that you can use on Labellerr

1.  **Bounding Box**
2.  **Polygon**
3.  **Dot**
4.  **Line**
5.  **Segmentation**
6.  **Landmark/Keypoint**

<Info>
For more on how to use annotations, check out the [How to Use Annotations](/actions/annotations-guide) guide.
</Info>

An annotation can also be edited based on classification, **Deleted** and **Hidden** easily. **Delete** can be used instead of **clear all answers** option if a single annotation is to be removed. **Hidden** is used when there is overlapping of different annotations. To avoid mistakes, some annotations can be hidden.

<Info>
For more on deleting and hiding annotations, check out the [Delete, Hide and Unhide annotations](/actions/delete-hide-unhide) guide.
</Info>

Additionally, some basic editing tools for the samples are available. Move, Brightness, Crop, and Zoom are the four available tools. They are present on the left of the sample.
