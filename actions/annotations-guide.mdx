## Everything you Need to Know About Image Annotation

---

### These are the annotation types that you can use on Labellerr.

1.  **Bounding Box**
2.  **Polygon**
3.  **Line**
4.  **Segmentation - Segment Anything**
5.  **Landmark/Keypoint**
6.  **Ellipse**

Once on the Labelling Screen, the tools appear on the left.

<Info>
Only the Objects selected while making a project would be visible. More can be added from the settings

### Bounding Box

Bounding box is a rectangular box used to highlight the location of an object. One of the most common types of annotation, generally used for object localization or detection.

description: "Learn how clients can efficiently review and manage annotated files in Labellerr using the grid view, with quick accept or reject options."
icon: grid-2
---

This feature allows clients to view files in a grid view, enabling users to quickly accept or reject files with just one click. Below, we provide step-by-step guidance on how to use this functionality.

### 1. Access the Annotated file

*   Labeling must be completed within the **Label** section.
*   Once labeling is done, files should be submitted.
*   Files must be accepted by a reviewer. All reviewer-accepted files will then appear in the **In Client Review** section.
*   Next, navigate to the **Files** section by clicking on it.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://cdn.labellerr.com/1%20%20Documentation/08682f4f-2064-45b6-a740-8879155a3ee5.webp" alt="Access Files Section" />
</Frame>

*   At the top of the page, in the **File Filters** section, you'll find the status bar. Use the dropdown menu to select the '**Ready for Client Review**' filter to display relevant files. You may also apply other filters as needed to narrow down your search and click on the **Apply Filters**.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Once the filter is applied, all your submitted files will be visible in the list, allowing you to view them easily in one place.

</Frame>

### 2. Review files in Grid View

Once the files appear, hover over the icon on the top right bar to reveal the '**Grid View**' option, then click it to switch to grid view.

</Frame>

You can now zoom in and out of the image using the slider, making it easier to view your annotated file clearly and in detail, so users can confidently accept or reject the file.

### 3. Reject a file by adding relevant remarks.

This feature adds remarks before rejection, ensuring clarity, transparency, and constructive feedback for better communication.

### Polygon

Polygon annotation is **a computer vision technique that outlines objects by connecting a series of points to form a polygon**. This accurately captures the true shape and boundaries of objects, making it ideal for handling complex or irregular shapes.

#### Drag Polygon

User can drag the cursor to draw the pixel perfect annotation on an object. Press ‘Shift’ key and then drag the cursor towards the boundaries of an object.

</Frame>

<Tip>
Press ‘N’ to close the polygon or simply drag the cursor to starting point.
</Tip>

### Line

Line annotation is mainly used to create lines across the image. Its basic use is road detection in self-driving vehicles.

</Frame>

### Segmentation - Segment Anything

Segmentation enables pixel-wise annotation. All the pixels highlighted are assigned to a particular class. This type of annotation is best for environments with complex structures, e.g., Self-driving vehicle AI. SAM is **a new AI model from Meta AI that can "cut out" any object, in any image, with a single click.**

### Landmark/Keypoint

Landmark and Key-point annotation is used in shape variation and small object detection. It works by creating dots across an image, usually used for the detection of facial features, gestures, emotions, poses and body part distinction.

### Ellipse

The **Ellipse annotation** is useful for the annotation of circular objects.
