### Key Elements and Functionalities

*   On the left would be **tools** for marking **objects and classification** questions that were created while making a new project.

*   **Mandatory questions** must be answered before submission but others can be skipped if not needed.

*   To use the **Autolabel** feature, an auto label model first needs to be attached.

*   ‘**Clear all answers’** removes the previous entries for a sample if corrections need to be made. Alternatively, you can also delete a single annotation using the delete button against that annotation.

*   If the classifications list is long, then a user can also search for the desired question pertaining to the current sample data from the **Search Question** option.

*   The **Settings option** can be used to update/change the annotation questions for the project.

*   If the sample is too distorted, blurry, or irrelevant then, the user can instead **skip** the sample and add a remark stating the reason for skipping.

*   After each sample is done being marked, click on **SUBMIT** present in the bottom left corner beneath the objects and classifications.

*   On the top right corner, the tool also shows how much time has been spent labelling the particular set and beneath it, the time spent at each session.
