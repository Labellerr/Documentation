### Download Format Options

2.  **JSON** - Select 'JSON' from the export format list. It's a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It uses key-value pairs.

3.  **COCO JSON** - Select 'COCO JSON' from the export format list. COCO (Common Objects in Context) JSON format is a widely used standard for annotating and sharing object detection, segmentation, and captioning datasets. It consists of annotations that describe the locations and categories of objects in images, along with metadata about the images themselves.

4.  **YOLO V5** - Select 'YOLO V5' from the export format list. This is a popular object detection algorithm that stands for "You Only Look Once version 5". It's an evolution of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series of object detection models. YOLOv5 offers improved performance and accuracy compared to its predecessors by leveraging various architectural improvements and training strategies.

You will again be taken to the exports screen, where the new export process starts.
