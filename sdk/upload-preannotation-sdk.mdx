## Overview

Pre-annotations enable you to import existing labels into your Labellerr projects, significantly reducing manual annotation effort. This feature allows your team to focus on reviewing and refining pre-loaded annotations rather than creating them from scratch.

  <Card title="Workflow Efficiency" icon="bolt">
    Reduce annotation time by up to 70% through pre-loaded label imports

</CardGroup>


## Critical Requirements

<Warning>
**File Name Matching is Mandatory**

For pre-annotations to function correctly, file names in your annotation JSON must exactly match the image file names in your Labellerr project.

**Validation Checklist:**
- Image file names in JSON (e.g., `"file_name"` field in COCO format) match uploaded image names
- File extensions match precisely (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`)
- File names are case-sensitive (`image.jpg` is not equal to `Image.jpg`)

**Examples:**

```json
// Correct - exact match
{"file_name": "burger.jpeg"}  → Uploaded as: burger.jpeg

// Incorrect - extension mismatch
{"file_name": "burger.jpeg"}  → Uploaded as: burger.jpg

// Incorrect - case mismatch
{"file_name": "burger.jpeg"}  → Uploaded as: Burger.jpeg
```

Mismatched file names will prevent annotations from being applied to the corresponding images.
</Warning>


## Implementation Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Synchronous Method">
    <Info>
      **Recommended for:** Batch processing scripts and sequential workflows where blocking behavior is acceptable
    </Info>

```python
from labellerr.client import LabellerrClient
from labellerr.exceptions import LabellerrError

# Initialize client with credentials
client = LabellerrClient('your_api_key', 'your_api_secret')

# Configure upload parameters
project_id = 'project_123'
client_id = '12345'
annotation_format = 'coco'
annotation_file = '/path/to/annotations.json'

try:
    # Execute synchronous upload
    result = client.upload_preannotation_by_project_id(
        project_id, 
        client_id, 
        annotation_format, 
        annotation_file
    )
    
    # Validate completion status
    if result['response']['status'] == 'completed':
        print("Pre-annotations processed successfully")
        
        # Extract metadata
        metadata = result['response'].get('metadata', {})
        print(f"Processing metadata: {metadata}")
        
except LabellerrError as e:
    print(f"Upload failed: {str(e)}")
```

<Note>
**Execution Behavior**: This method blocks execution until processing completes. Processing duration varies based on file size and annotation count.
</Note>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Asynchronous Method">
    <Info>
      **Recommended for:** Production applications, web services, and scenarios requiring non-blocking operations
    </Info>

```python
from labellerr.client import LabellerrClient
from labellerr.exceptions import LabellerrError

# Initialize client with credentials
client = LabellerrClient('your_api_key', 'your_api_secret')

# Configure upload parameters
project_id = 'project_123'
client_id = '12345'
annotation_format = 'coco'
annotation_file = '/path/to/annotations.json'

try:
    # Initiate asynchronous upload
    future = client.upload_preannotation_by_project_id_async(
        project_id, 
        client_id, 
        annotation_format, 
        annotation_file
    )
    
    print("Upload initiated - processing asynchronously")
    
    # Execute concurrent operations
    # perform_other_tasks()
    
    # Retrieve result when ready
    try:
        result = future.result(timeout=300)  # 5 minute timeout
        
        if result['response']['status'] == 'completed':
            print("Pre-annotations processed successfully")
            metadata = result['response'].get('metadata', {})
            print(f"Processing metadata: {metadata}")
            
    except TimeoutError:
        print("Processing exceeded timeout threshold")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Processing error: {str(e)}")
        
except LabellerrError as e:
    print(f"Upload initialization failed: {str(e)}")
```

<Note>
**Execution Behavior**: Returns immediately with a Future object, enabling concurrent task execution during background processing.

    - Large-scale file processing
    
    **Characteristics:**
    - Non-blocking operation
    - Immediate return
    - Configurable timeout handling
    - Parallel task support
  </Card>

## Processing Workflow

Both implementation methods follow an identical server-side processing pipeline:

<Steps>
  <Step title="File Upload">
    Annotation JSON file is transmitted to Labellerr infrastructure
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Format Validation">
    File structure and format are validated against COCO specification and project schema
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="File Name Resolution">
    Image file names referenced in annotations are matched against project assets
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Annotation Application">
    Validated annotations are applied to matched images within the project
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Status Return">
    Processing status and metadata are returned to the client application
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Performance Guidelines**: Processing duration correlates with file size and annotation count. Files under 1 MB with fewer than 100 annotations typically process within 30 seconds. Larger datasets may require several minutes.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Annotations Not Applied to Images" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Symptom**: Upload completes successfully but annotations are not visible on project images.
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    - Verify exact file name matching between JSON and uploaded images (case-sensitive)
    - Confirm file extension consistency (`.jpg` vs `.jpeg` vs `.png`)
    - Validate annotation format parameter is set to `'coco'`
    - Ensure images were uploaded to project prior to pre-annotation upload
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Upload Timeout or Connection Failure" icon="clock">
    **Symptom**: Upload operation fails with timeout or network connection errors.
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    - Verify file size is within 25 MB limit
    - Utilize asynchronous method with extended timeout configuration
    - Confirm network stability and connectivity
    - Validate JSON file conforms to COCO format specification
    - Consider splitting large files into smaller batches
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Format Validation Error" icon="file-circle-xmark">
    **Symptom**: API returns format or structure validation errors.
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    - Validate JSON structure against COCO format specification
    - Ensure all required COCO fields are present (`images`, `annotations`, `categories`)
    - Verify annotation coordinates are within valid image bounds
    - Confirm category IDs in annotations match category definitions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication or Permission Errors" icon="lock">
    **Symptom**: Upload fails with authentication or authorization errors.
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    - Verify API key and secret credentials are correct
    - Confirm client ID matches your organization
    - Validate write access permissions for the target project
    - Ensure project exists and project ID is accurate
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Response Schema

Successful upload operations return a structured response:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "status": "completed",
    "activity_id": "9c696f10-7e76-40e0-9852-34b99be2db52",
    "metadata": {
      "total_annotations": 42,
      "matched_files": 10,
      "unmatched_files": 0,
      "processing_time_seconds": 15.3
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
**Status Values**:
- `completed` - Annotations successfully applied to project
- `processing` - Upload in progress (asynchronous method)
- `failed` - Processing encountered errors (review error details)
</Note>
