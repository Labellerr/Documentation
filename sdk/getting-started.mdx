## Introduction

The **Labellerr SDK** is a Python library designed to make interaction with the Labellerr platform simple and efficient. With this SDK, you can manage data annotations, projects, and exports seamlessly in your applications.

This documentation will guide you through installing the SDK, understanding its core functionalities, and handling common errors.

Prefer a runnable notebook with sample data and ready-made cells? [Open the end-to-end SDK cookbook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Labellerr/Hands-On-Learning-in-Computer-Vision/blob/main/SDK%20Tutorials/Labellerr_SDK_End_to_End_Annotation_Pipeline.ipynb)

## Installation

To install the Labellerr SDK, use the following command:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" title="Install Labellerr SDK">
pip install https://github.com/tensormatics/SDKPython/releases/download/prod/labellerr_sdk-1.0.0.tar.gz
</CodeBlock>

---

## Getting Started

#### Obtaining `api_keys` and `client_id`:

**To obtain your api_keys and client_id, Pro and Enterprise plan users can contact Labellerr support. If you are on a free plan, you can request them by emailing** `**support@tensormatics.com**`**.**

Once installed, you can start by importing and initializing the `LabellerrClient` and `LabellerrError`. This client will handle all communication with the Labellerr platform.

### Example Client initiation:

<CodeBlock lang="python" title="Client Initialization">
from labellerr.client import LabellerrClient
from labellerr.exceptions import LabellerrError

# Initialize the client with your API credentials
api_key = "your-api-key"
api_secret = "your-api-secret"
client_id = "your-client-id"
project_id = 'your-project-id'
# choose scope from SCOPE_LIST=['project','client','public']
scope = 'client'
email = "your-email-id"

client = LabellerrClient(api_key, api_secret)
</CodeBlock>

Replace `'your_api_key', 'your-email-id', 'client_id', 'project_id'` and `'your-api-secret'` with your actual credentials provided by Labellerr.
