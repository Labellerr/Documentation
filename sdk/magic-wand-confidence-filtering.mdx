## How It Works

When you upload pre-annotations with confidence buckets, the Magic Wand feature automatically appears in the annotation interface, allowing annotators to filter annotations based on their confidence levels.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload with Confidence Bucket">
    Upload your pre-annotations using the SDK with a specified confidence bucket parameter
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Magic Wand Appears">
    The slider control automatically appears in the annotation interface for files with confidence-tagged annotations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Filter by Confidence">
    Annotators use the slider to show/hide annotations based on confidence thresholds
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review & Refine">
    Focus on reviewing lower-confidence predictions while quickly accepting high-confidence ones
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SDK Implementation

### Upload Pre-annotations with Confidence Bucket

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Low Confidence">
    <Info>
      **Use Case**: Model predictions with low certainty (< 50% confidence) that require careful human review
    </Info>

```python
from labellerr.client import LabellerrClient

# Initialize client
client = LabellerrClient(
    api_key='your_api_key',
    api_secret='your_api_secret', 
    client_id='your_client_id'
)

# Upload with low confidence bucket
result = client.upload_preannotation_by_project_id(
    project_id='your_project_id',
    client_id='your_client_id',
    annotation_format='coco_json',
    annotation_file='annotations.json',
    conf_bucket='low'  # Low confidence annotations
)

print(f"Status: {result['response']['status']}")
```

<Note>
**Best For**: Uncertain predictions, edge cases, or challenging images that need thorough human validation
</Note>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Medium Confidence">
    <Info>
      **Use Case**: Model predictions with moderate certainty (50-80% confidence) that benefit from quick review
    </Info>

```python
from labellerr.client import LabellerrClient

# Initialize client
client = LabellerrClient(
    api_key='your_api_key',
    api_secret='your_api_secret',
    client_id='your_client_id'
)

# Upload with medium confidence bucket
result = client.upload_preannotation_by_project_id(
    project_id='your_project_id',
    client_id='your_client_id',
    annotation_format='coco_json',
    annotation_file='annotations.json',
    conf_bucket='medium'  # Medium confidence annotations
)

print(f"Status: {result['response']['status']}")
```

<Note>
**Best For**: Standard predictions that warrant verification but are likely accurate
</Note>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="High Confidence">
    <Info>
      **Use Case**: Model predictions with high certainty (> 80% confidence) that may only need spot-checking
    </Info>

```python
from labellerr.client import LabellerrClient

# Initialize client
client = LabellerrClient(
    api_key='your_api_key',
    api_secret='your_api_secret',
    client_id='your_client_id'
)

# Upload with high confidence bucket
result = client.upload_preannotation_by_project_id(
    project_id='your_project_id',
    client_id='your_client_id',
    annotation_format='coco_json',
    annotation_file='annotations.json',
    conf_bucket='high'  # High confidence annotations
)

print(f"Status: {result['response']['status']}")
```

<Note>
**Best For**: Highly confident predictions on clear, unambiguous objects that rarely need correction
</Note>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's a comprehensive example showing how to segment your model's predictions by confidence and upload them accordingly:

```python
import json
from labellerr.client import LabellerrClient
from labellerr.exceptions import LabellerrError

# Initialize client
client = LabellerrClient(
    api_key='your_api_key',
    api_secret='your_api_secret',
    client_id='your_client_id'
)

# Project configuration
project_id = 'your_project_id'
client_id = 'your_client_id'

# Separate your predictions by confidence
prediction_files = {
    'low': 'predictions_low_confidence.json',     # < 0.5 confidence
    'medium': 'predictions_medium_confidence.json', # 0.5 - 0.8 confidence
    'high': 'predictions_high_confidence.json'     # > 0.8 confidence
}

# Upload each confidence bucket
results = {}

for confidence_level, file_path in prediction_files.items():
    try:
        print(f"Uploading {confidence_level} confidence annotations...")
        
        result = client.upload_preannotation_by_project_id(
            project_id=project_id,
            client_id=client_id,
            annotation_format='coco_json',
            annotation_file=file_path,
            conf_bucket=confidence_level
        )
        
        results[confidence_level] = result
        print(f"✓ {confidence_level.capitalize()} confidence upload complete")
        
        # Extract metadata
        metadata = result['response'].get('metadata', {})
        if 'files_not_updated' in metadata:
            print(f"  Files processed: {metadata.get('files_not_updated', [])}")
            
    except LabellerrError as e:
        print(f"✗ Failed to upload {confidence_level} confidence: {str(e)}")
        results[confidence_level] = {'error': str(e)}

# Summary
print("\n" + "="*50)
print("Upload Summary:")
print("="*50)
for level, result in results.items():
    status = "Success" if 'error' not in result else "Failed"
    print(f"{level.capitalize()}: {status}")
```

## Magic Wand Usage in Annotation Interface

Once annotations are uploaded with confidence buckets, annotators can leverage the Magic Wand slider:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accessing the Magic Wand" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    1. Open a file with uploaded pre-annotations
    2. Look for the Magic Wand icon/slider in the left sidebar
    3. The tool appears automatically when confidence-tagged annotations exist
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using the Confidence Slider" icon="sliders">
    1. Drag the slider to adjust the confidence threshold
    2. Annotations below the threshold are hidden
    3. Annotations above the threshold remain visible
    4. Use this to focus on reviewing specific confidence ranges
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Workflow Optimization" icon="bolt">
    **Efficient Review Strategy**:
    1. Start with low confidence threshold (show all annotations)
    2. Review and correct low-confidence predictions first
    3. Gradually increase threshold to review medium confidence
    4. Quickly verify high-confidence predictions
    5. Submit when all confidence levels are validated
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Parameter Reference

### `conf_bucket` Parameter

<ParamField path="conf_bucket" type="string" required>
  Specifies the confidence level for uploaded pre-annotations

  **Valid Values**:
  - `'low'` - For predictions with low confidence (typically < 50%)
  - `'medium'` - For predictions with medium confidence (typically 50-80%)
  - `'high'` - For predictions with high confidence (typically > 80%)

  **Default**: `None` (no confidence filtering applied)

  <Warning>
    The confidence bucket parameter is **case-sensitive**. Use lowercase values: `'low'`, `'medium'`, `'high'`
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Magic Wand Not Appearing" icon="eye-slash">
    **Symptom**: The slider control doesn't appear in the annotation interface.
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    - Verify annotations were uploaded with `conf_bucket` parameter specified
    - Confirm the confidence bucket value was set to 'low', 'medium', or 'high'
    - Check that pre-annotations were successfully applied (no file name mismatches)
    - Refresh the annotation interface
    - Ensure you're using the latest version of Labellerr
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="All Annotations Same Confidence" icon="equals">
    **Symptom**: Slider doesn't filter anything; all annotations appear at same level.
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    - Verify you uploaded different confidence buckets in separate uploads
    - Check that you didn't upload all predictions with the same conf_bucket value
    - Ensure your prediction pipeline correctly segments by confidence
    - Re-upload with properly categorized confidence levels
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Incorrect Confidence Categories" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Symptom**: Annotations appear in wrong confidence categories.
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    - Review your confidence score thresholds in preprocessing
    - Verify the mapping between confidence scores and bucket labels
    - Check for any errors in your prediction segmentation logic
    - Consider recalibrating your model if systematic misalignment exists
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
