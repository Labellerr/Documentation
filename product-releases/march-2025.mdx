Our new Magic Editor helps you refine image annotations at the pixel level. It fixes sharp edges and missing labels without disturbing your existing work.

**Key Features:**
- Make smooth boundary corrections using simple keyboard shortcuts
- Works perfectly with SAM's one-dot labeling feature for better precision
- Easily merge unlabeled areas by moving keypoints

This tool is very useful in retail for product outlining, in medical imaging, and for any object detection task where precision matters. It saves you time by removing the need to manually drag keypoints, all while keeping your annotation shapes perfect.

We also released new Precision Masking and Boundary Tools. These tools use a superpixel segmentation system to automatically group pixels and create masks for you.

**Key Features:**
- Create high-resolution masks without drawing them by hand
- Improve accuracy for irregular and complex shapes
- Fine control over object boundaries

**Use Cases:**
- **Fashion Industry**: Analyze fabric patterns and segment garments
- **Medical Imaging**: Create precise segmentations of tumors and organs
- **Automotive**: Annotate vehicle parts for autonomous driving applications
